This License Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into by and between the Norwegian Cyber Defence Directorate (NCDD) or its authorized delegate ("Licensor") and the recipient entity or individual ("Licensee").

1. GRANT OF LICENSE
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and compliance with NCDD Mandate 2026, Licensor grants Licensee a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to use, reproduce internally, and execute the Tactical Tools software and associated documentation ("Licensed Materials") solely for authorized red-team, adversary emulation, or operational security testing activities under OMEGA-level clearance.

This license is granted strictly for Licensee's internal operational use within air-gapped or controlled environments. No right is granted to distribute, disclose, modify for external use, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works except as explicitly required for mandate-compliant testing and only within the scope of an approved NCDD engagement.

2. RESTRICTIONS
Licensee shall not:
(a) Copy, reproduce, publish, or disclose the Licensed Materials, in whole or in part, to any third party without prior written NCDD authorization.
(b) Use the Licensed Materials for any purpose other than authorized red-cell activities under Mandate 2026.
(c) Remove, alter, or obscure any proprietary notices, classification markings, or cryptographic validation headers.
(d) Export, re-export, or transfer the Licensed Materials in violation of Norwegian export control laws, EU Dual-Use Regulation 2021/821, or equivalent international regimes.
(e) Attempt to discover source logic, algorithms, or evade the mandate verification mechanism (verify_authority).

All access is governed by "need-to-know" principles. Licensee must maintain audit logs of all access and usage.

3. OWNERSHIP AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Licensor retains all right, title, and interest in the Licensed Materials, including all patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights. This Agreement conveys no ownership interest.

4. MANDATE COMPLIANCE & VERIFICATION
Use of the Licensed Materials requires successful execution of the built-in authority verification procedure. Failure to validate against NCDD Mandate 2026 will disable core functionality. Licensee agrees to report any verification failures immediately to mandate@ncdd.no (internal channel only).

5. TERMINATION
This license terminates immediately upon:
- Breach of any provision herein
- Revocation of OMEGA clearance
- Completion or cancellation of the associated red-team engagement
- Written notice from Licensor

Upon termination, Licensee shall destroy or return all copies of the Licensed Materials and certify such action in writing.

6. NO WARRANTY / LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
THE LICENSED MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LICENSED MATERIALS.

7. GOVERNING LAW
This Agreement is governed by Norwegian law. Disputes shall be resolved exclusively through internal NCDD channels or designated Norwegian courts.

8. ENTIRE AGREEMENT
This Agreement, together with NCDD Mandate 2026 and any associated Security Aspects Letter (SAL), constitutes the entire understanding and supersedes all prior agreements.
