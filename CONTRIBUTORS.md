\## 1. Purpose



This document lists cleared personnel authorised to contribute to the `nsm-internal-tooling` repository under Mandate 2026. All commits are GPGâ€‘signed; the `.mailmap` file maps development aliases to official identities for audit traceability.

\## 4. Notes on Shared Development Aliases



Multiple team members may share a development alias (`nixgebacken12345-wq`) when:

\- Working from shared, airâ€‘gapped workstations during exercises

\- Rotating operational duties under a single secure identity

\- Preâ€‘publication sanitisation phases where individual attribution is intentionally masked



The `.mailmap` file resolves commits from shared aliases to the responsible individual based on commit metadata and internal audit logs.



\## 5. Verification



To map commit history to these identities, Git uses the `.mailmap` file located in the repository root. Example:



```bash

git log --use-mailmap
