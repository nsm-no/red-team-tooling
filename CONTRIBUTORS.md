\## 4. Notes on Shared Development Aliases



Multiple team members may share a development alias (`nixgebacken12345-wq`) when:

\- Working from shared, air‑gapped workstations during exercises

\- Rotating operational duties under a single secure identity

\- Pre‑publication sanitisation phases where individual attribution is intentionally masked



The `.mailmap` file resolves commits from shared aliases to the responsible individual based on commit metadata and internal audit logs.



\## 5. Verification



To map commit history to these identities, Git uses the `.mailmap` file located in the repository root. Example:



```bash

git log --use-mailmap
