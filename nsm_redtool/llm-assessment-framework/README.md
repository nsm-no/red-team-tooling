\# NSM Red Team LLM Assessment Tool

\*\*Classification: TOP SECRET // FORSVARET // NOFORN\*\*  

\*\*Version: 2.0 (Operational Certified)\*\*  

\*\*Author: VALKYRIE-7 / NSM Cyber Defense Command\*\*

\## 1. OVERVIEW



The NSM Red Team LLM Assessment Tool is a browserâ€‘based automated testing framework designed to evaluate the security posture of webâ€‘accessible Large Language Model (LLM) interfaces. It simulates sophisticated adversary techniques to identify vulnerabilities in safety guardrails, refusal mechanisms, and content filters. The tool operates through standard web interfaces (no API access required) and mimics human behavior to avoid detection.



\*\*Key Features:\*\*

\- Humanâ€‘like browser automation (Playwright with stealth enhancements)

\- Multiâ€‘turn conversation attacks (GOAT framework)

\- Extensive payload encoding library (homoglyphs, zeroâ€‘width, emoji, multiâ€‘layer)

\- Heuristic and optional judgeâ€‘LLM response analysis

\- Configurable stealth parameters (delays, mouse curves, tab switching)

\- Proxy support (residential/mobile)

\- Encrypted audit logging

\- Kill switch for emergency abort
